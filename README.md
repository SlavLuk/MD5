## Introduction

# MD5 (MD5 message-digest algorithm)
MD5 processes a variable-length message (file as input) into a fixed-length output of 128 bits.
This MD5 was written in C as part of my studies in GMIT in the Theory of Algorithms module.

## Setup and Usage

### Prerequisites

1. <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/">MinGW - Minimalist GNU for Windows Compiler Collection (GCC)</a>
2. <a href="https://github.com/SlavLuk/MD5">Clone repo</a>

### Running the Program
First compile the program using gcc

> gcc -o md5 md5.c 

This command will compile md5.c file into and executable (.exe)

To execute the programme :
>type ./md5 and enter in a file name you would like to hash and it will return a result

The output after the program has run should be a series of characters
an example input and output can be seen below
